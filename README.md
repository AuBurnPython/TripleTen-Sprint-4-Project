# TripleTen-Sprint-4-Project
This is a project using a large csv file full of different vehicles, transmission type, year model, sell price, etc. Using this data
I created a website to access better visuals for viewing it. Charts, sliders, and the raw data as well. I used pandas, streamlit, plotly.express, altair, and used Render
to deploy the web app. To deploy the app on your own computer, first you want to clone the repository. While in your command prompt on your computer, use 'git clone https://github.com/AuBurnPython/TripleTen-Sprint-4-Project.git' (using '' to isolate the text you need to use, do not add the apostrophes). Next navigate to the project directory:
Change your directory to the project folder:'cd TripleTen-Sprint-4-Project'
Next you want to set up your virtual environment. On Windows Command Prompt, type 'python -m venv venv' then type '.\venv\Scripts\activate' 
After activating your virtual environment, you need to install the required folders that the web app configures itself with. 
Use, 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the command prompt to install the necessary files.
Now you can run the streamlit app by running 'streamlit run app.py' into the command prompt.
Open the URL that your command prompt gives you: Example; 'http://localhost:8501'
To shut down the app when finished, run 'deactivate' in the command prompt or use CTRL + C.
