# TripleTen-Sprint-4-Project
This is a project using a large csv file full of different vehicles, transmission type, year model, sell price, etc. Using this data
I created a website to access better visuals for viewing it. Charts, sliders, and the raw data as well. I used pandas, streamlit, plotly.express, altair, and used Render
to deploy the web app. To deploy the app on your own computer, first you want to clone this repository. Then set up a virtual environment (make sure its activated) and 
install the requirements.txt file. Finally, you can have streamlit run the app.py and it will give you the url.  @ https://tripleten-sprint-4-project-w1uj.onrender.com/
