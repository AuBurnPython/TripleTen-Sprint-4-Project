# TripleTen-Sprint-4-Project
This is a project using a large csv file full of different vehicles, transmission type, year model, sell price, etc. Using this data
I created a website to access better visuals for viewing it. Charts, sliders, and the raw data as well. I used pandas, streamlit, plotly.express, altair, and used Render
to deploy the web app. To launch the web app, simply type the url into search engine and enjoy! @ https://tripleten-sprint-4-project-w1uj.onrender.com/
